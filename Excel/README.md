# Excel Projects

**Vehicle Sales Data Analysis using Excel/Power Pivot**
The "SQL for Data Analytics" book by Upom Malik, Matt Goldwasser, and Benjamin Johnson (Packt Publishing) provided links to a sample dataset to learn and practice PostgreSQL. 

This dataset contains sales, product (automobiles & scooters), and other information. The sales and product tables were exported from PostgreSQL as CSV files and imported into Excel. The sales data starts in 2010 and runs through May of 2019. The goal of the project was to review the overall sales (revenue & count) and try to determine if the company is on track for the remainder of 2019. 

**Excel Functions & Formulas Used**
*Pivot Tables
*SUMIFS
*COUNTIFS
*XLOOKUP
*Charts (Bar, Stacked Bar, Line, Combo-Bar & Line)
*YEAR/MONTH extraction from dates
*Quarter extraction from dates
