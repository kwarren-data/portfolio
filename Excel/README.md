# Excel Projects

**Vehicle Sales Data Analysis using Excel/Power Pivot**
The "SQL for Data Analytics" book by Upom Malik, Matt Goldwasser, and Benjamin Johnson (Packt Publishing) provided links to a sample dataset to learn and practice PostgreSQL. Using PostgreSQL, a few of the database tables were exported as CSV files to provide the source data for this Excel/Power Pivot project.
