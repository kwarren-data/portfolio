## CRM Sales Opportunities Analysis with Power BI

This dataset contains information from a fictional company that sells computer hardware. It is available from the Maven Analytics Data 
Playground at: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground. 
There were 4 CSV files included in this dataset:

* Accounts – contains information regarding customers.
* Sales Pipeline – contains information about bids, including dates, status (won/lost/prospecting/engaging), value of the sale, and sales agent.
* Sales Team – list of sales agents, sales manager, and office location.
* Products – list of products for sale, including their retail price.

### Project Goal
The goal of this project was to visualize the sales opportunities in a Power BI dashboard to show an overview of how well the sales 
have been going and for the Sales Managers to understand how their teams have been performing.
