# Python Projects

**Global Shark Attack File Analysis**

The Python files, in Jupyter Notebook format, are based on the Global Shark Attack File data from the Shark Research Institute (SRI). The data is available to download here: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm.

The first project, named "gsaf_analysis_v2.ipynb", contains the code and markdown for an exploratory data analysis of worldwide shark attacks. The second project, named "gsaf_florida_v2.ipynb", is a follow-on to the data analysis of worldwide shark attacks. This second project explores the GSAF with a focus on shark attacks occurring in Florida, USA.

These projects required importing raw data, cleaning the data, performing some exploratory data analysis, and creating some visualizations.
