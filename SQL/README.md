# SQL Projects

**Vehicle Sales**

One PostgreSQL project utilized the fictional car company database provided by the book, "SQL for Data Analytics" by Upom Malik, Matt Goldwasser, and Benjamin Johnston. This project explored the database to learn more about it, as well as trying to answer a few questions on how the vehicle sales have been changing over time. This project file is named **vehicle_sales_v1.sql**. 

**Aliens In America**

The PostgreSQL data analysis project was based on a ficticious dataset of aliens (extraterrestrial) living in America. This dataset was created by Ian Klosowicz, and is available via Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandrepetit881234/ian-k-aliens-in-america or Ian's website: https://iklosowicz.gumroad.com/l/aliens-in-america 

This data contains three separate files with information regarding aliens in America. Some of the information includes the type of alien, gender, feeding behavior, whether they are aggressive or not, and location information. The first SQL file, named **Setting_up_the_Aliens_DB.sql**, has the queries used to create and populate the database tables for the aliens data. The second file, named **Exploring_the_Aliens_DB .sql**, contains a variety of queries used to explore the data, including joining the tables together to answer a few questions.
