**Aliens In America**

The PostgreSQL data analysis project was based on a ficticious dataset of aliens (extraterrestrial) living in America. This dataset was created by Ian Klosowicz, and is available via Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandrepetit881234/ian-k-aliens-in-america or Ian's website: https://iklosowicz.gumroad.com/l/aliens-in-america 

This data contains three separate files with information regarding aliens in America. Some of the information includes the type of alien, gender, feeding behavior, whether they are aggressive or not, and location information. The first SQL file, named "Setting_up_the_Aliens_DB.sql", has the queries used to create and populate the database tables for the aliens data. The second file, named "Exploring_the_Aliens_DB .sql", contains a variety of queries used to explore the data, including joining the tables together to answer a few questions.
