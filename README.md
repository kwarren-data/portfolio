## Ken Warren's Data Analysis Project Portfolio

This portfolio contains sample data analysis projects using Python and PostgreSQL. The Python files,
in Jupyter Notebook format, are based on the Global Shark Attack File data from the Shark Research
Institute (SRI). The data is available to download here: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm
The first project, named "gsaf_analysis_v2.ipynb", contains the code and markdown for an exploratory data 
analysis of worldwide shark attacks. The second project, named "gsaf_florida_v2.ipynb", is a follow-on to 
the data analysis of worldwide shark attacks. This second project explores the GSAF with a focus on shark 
attacks occurring in Florida, USA. 

The PostgreSQL data analysis project was based on a ficticious dataset of aliens living in America. This 
dataset was created by Ian Klosowicz, and is available via Kaggle at: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandrepetit881234/ian-k-aliens-in-america
or Ian's website: https://iklosowicz.gumroad.com/l/aliens-in-america
This data contains three separate files with information regarding aliens (not from Earth) in America. Some
of the information includes the type of alien, gender, feeding behavior, whether they are aggressive or not,
and location information. The first SQL file, named "Setting_up_the_Aliens_DB.sql", has the queries used to 
create and populate the database tables for the aliens data. The second file, named "Exploring_the_Aliens_DB
.sql", contains a variety of queries used to explore the data, including joining the tables together to answer
a few questions.
