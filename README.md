# Ken Warren's Project Portfolio

This portfolio contains sample data analysis projects using Python as Jupyter Notebook files. The
first project, named "gsaf_analysis_v2.ipynb", contains the code and markdown for an exploratory 
data analysis of worldwide shark attacks. The data is available from the Shark Research Institute's
(SRI) website in form of the Global Shark Attack File (GSAF).

The second project, named "gsaf_florida_v2.ipynb", is somewhat of a follow-on to the data analysis
project on worldwide shark attacks. This second project explores the GSAF with a focus on shark attacks
in Florida, USA.
